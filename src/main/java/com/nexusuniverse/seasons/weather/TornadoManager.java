/**
 * A genuine physics-driven tornado, built entirely from real velocity manipulation and either
 * particles or real blocks, no resource pack. The funnel's actual trunk is REAL COBWEB BLOCKS
 * (maybeRebuildCobwebFunnel()/tornado.cobweb-funnel.*) rather than particles by default -- solid,
 * textured, persistent geometry that reads as a genuine physical funnel instead of a haze of dots.
 * Placed following the same funnelRadiusAt() shape (pointed base, flared top) as everything else
 * in this class, tracked in a Map so exactly the blocks this system placed get restored to
 * whatever was there before once they're no longer part of the current shape or the tornado ends
 * -- same non-destructive-by-default rule as every other effect in this "crazy weather" layer.
 * IMPORTANT tradeoff, worth knowing about: real blocks are far more expensive to update than
 * particles (each placement/removal is a real world edit, not just a client-side visual), so the
 * cobweb funnel only recomputes its rotated shape every tornado.cobweb-funnel.update-interval-
 * ticks (a handful of times a second) rather than every tick -- it spins in small, cheap steps
 * instead of the buttery-smooth continuous motion particles give for free. The original
 * particle-based rings/dense-fill (renderFunnel()/renderDenseBody()) are still in the code and
 * fully working, just off by default (tornado.funnel-particles-enabled) now that cobwebs handle
 * the trunk -- flip that back on to layer both together, or to go back to the original look.
 *
 * The wide spiraling cloud canopy (renderCloudCanopy()) up near the top is unchanged and still
 * particle-based -- a log-spiral disc far wider than the funnel itself, standing in for the
 * rotating storm cloud (mesocyclone) a real tornado actually descends from. This is the "swirling
 * around the cyclone" layer that stays as particles: still spawns every particle with the
 * spawnParticle(count=0, offsets-as-velocity) trick for genuine per-particle curving motion, not
 * just a new randomly-jittered position every tick -- that distinction is what makes it read as
 * something actually spinning up close, not just a shape that happens to rotate. "Leaf debris" in
 * the (optional, off-by-default) particle rings is simulated with tinted DUST particles rather
 * than a literal leaf particle, since there isn't a stable, guaranteed-available vanilla particle
 * for that -- see FogManager's doc comment for the same kind of honest caveat applied to real API
 * limits.
 *
 * SEPARATELY, maybeLaunchDebris()/updateDebris() add real flying blocks orbiting OUTSIDE the
 * funnel's own trunk -- actual FallingBlock entities picked up from the natural terrain within
 * the funnel's radius (tornado.debris.materials, deliberately grass/dirt/sand/logs/leaves/stone
 * rather than anything players commonly build with), given the same kind of self-updating
 * tangential-swirl velocity every tick so they trace a real spiraling orbit upward around the
 * funnel rather than just flying off in one direction. Non-destructive by default -- once a
 * debris block's short lifetime ends, the original block gets put back where it was picked up
 * from (tornado.debris.restore-terrain).
 *
 * Physics, applied to every player within the tornado's radius and height each tick:
 *  - PULL: velocity nudged toward the vortex center, stronger the closer they are.
 *  - LIFT: upward velocity, same distance falloff -- being near the center means getting picked
 *    up, not just yanked sideways.
 *  - SWIRL: a tangential (perpendicular-to-center) component so it reads as being spun around the
 *    vortex, not just dragged straight to a point.
 *  All three are added together and capped at tornado.max-velocity-per-tick so nobody gets
 *  launched into orbit from one bad tick.
 *
 * Fragile blocks (tornado.destroy-fragile-blocks, reuses wind.fragile-materials) within radius
 * have a budgeted, throttled chance per tick of getting ripped up -- same "remove the block, spawn
 * a real dropped item with outward+upward+swirl velocity" approach WindManager uses for severe
 * gusts, just far more aggressive and constant while a tornado is actively overhead.
 *
 * The tornado itself drifts across the terrain over its lifetime (a slow random walk, not a fixed
 * point) rather than sitting still, so it reads as a moving storm passing through rather than a
 * stationary special-effect.
 *
 * Also forces a REAL vanilla thunderstorm (genuine dark sky, not a particle effect -- see
 * spawnAt()) on its world for as long as it's active, through WeatherCycleManager's own override
 * mechanism rather than fighting that manager's tick-by-tick weather reassertion directly.
 * Reverts to that manager's normal cycle automatically the instant the tornado ends, whether that's
 * naturally or stopped early.
